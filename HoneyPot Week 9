HoneyPot Week 9 Write Up

I sucessfully deployed a honeypot with http with dionea.  It was attacked multiple times while running the following screenshots show the
honey pot implementation and sensor information. I wasn't able to extract the information via a json due to the vm not allowing me to 
access it anymore.

Some other issues that came up where even just implentmenting and get it up and running, I created instances and was not able to access the 
login screens. I'm not sure if this is due to issues with trying to use a windows platform, to perform these functions or maybe the incorrect 
browser was causing the issues. 

The things I was able to gain insight from this assignment about where why honeypots are implemented, why they are effective and why you 
should deploy multiple honeypots to protect your network.

These two images show me both using MHN Server to both monitor attacks and deploying the honeypot with Dionea
